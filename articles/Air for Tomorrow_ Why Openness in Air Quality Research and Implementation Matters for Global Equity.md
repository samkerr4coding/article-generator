# Air for Tomorrow: Why Openness in Air Quality Research and Implementation Matters for Global Equity

The global air quality crisis is staggering: 99% of the world’s population breathes air exceeding the World Health Organization’s annual limits[1], resulting in an estimated $6 trillion in global yearly health costs as per the World Bank[2], with 9 out of 10 deaths attributed to outdoor air pollution, particularly in low- and middle-income countries[3]. The current approach to air quality research and monitoring faces significant challenges, largely due to proprietary models, closed datasets, and inaccessible research outputs. This immense scale of the socio-economic problem demands collaborative, scalable, and equitable solutions, an urgency that has never been greater.

The principle of Open Source offers a powerful solution. Instead of confining critical air quality data and methodologies behind paywalls, with restrictive access to proprietary algorithms and tools, siloed air quality databases, an open approach is transforming how we research, understand, and respond to air quality[4]. This methodology not only fosters inclusivity but also enhances adaptability and transparency. We explore the value of open approaches in air quality science, their crucial role in equity and innovation, and how they are already reshaping our understanding and response to environmental threats.

We at UNICEF Lao PDR Country Office[5] have collaborated with UNICEF East Asia Pacific’s Frontier Data Lab[6], UNICEF Office of Innovation[7], and AQAI[8] to showcase the role of open-source technologies in air quality monitoring. This initiative is part of a multi-part blog series designed to explore the world of open approaches in air quality science. We begin with how open-source data and tools are utilized in air quality monitoring, and later, we’ll delve into open-source modelling and share experiences on how these systems can ensure environmental justice.

On the technical side, we’re examining open source, open data, and open methods – a framework that provides a slice of how they’re used in real-world use cases for leading humanitarian organizations, notably UNICEF, the United Nations agency for children, working to protect the rights of every child, particularly those most disadvantaged and hardest to reach[9].

Open source, open methods, and open data form three interconnected pillars of openness, driving innovation and ensuring equitable access to vital information. Open source refers to software that is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. Open data is information that is publicly accessible and can be used without restrictions. Open methods encompass the transparent and reproducible processes used to collect and analyze air quality data.

Currently, challenges remain. Data quality and completeness are paramount. Standardizing calibration protocols and establishing robust validation frameworks for low-cost sensors is an ongoing effort. Furthermore, convincing government data owners to embrace open-sourcing their data is not yet fully streamlined – many countries still do not make their data publicly available.

Licensing ambiguities also present a hurdle. Many “open” datasets come with vague or restrictive licenses, deterring reuse. Harmonizing licensing standards – adopting Creative Commons or Open Data Commons standards – would facilitate collaboration.  Finally, sustaining open-source initiatives requires long-term funding mechanisms and public-private partnerships, as many projects rely on short-term grants or volunteer labour.

Despite these challenges, significant progress is being made. The Clean Air Fund and OpenAQ [10] are working together to build country-level open air quality ecosystems, particularly in Africa and Asia. UNICEF Office of innovation, Venture Fund supports startups like AQAI [11] , and UNICEF teams such as Frontier Data Lab, UNICEF Lao PDR Country Offices, which are building open-source GeoAI tools for air pollution estimation using remote sensing and AI [12].

These efforts, along with Open Environmental Data Coalitions like Open Climate [13], are bringing together stakeholders to co-create standards and repositories.  A shoutout to academic partners like the National University of Laos as we co-develop the next stage.

Air for Tomorrow: We must recognize that air pollution is a global crisis, but its solutions must be local, inclusive, and adaptive. Embracing open data, open source, and open methods accelerates innovation and ensures no one is left behind in the fight for clean air. “We all breathe.”

Stay tuned for our upcoming articles on the air quality digital landscape, where we explore the state of the art in Open-Source Air Quality Monitoring.
