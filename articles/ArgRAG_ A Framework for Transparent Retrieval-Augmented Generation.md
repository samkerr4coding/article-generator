# ArgRAG: A Framework for Transparent Retrieval-Augmented Generation

The research presented details ArgRAG, a novel approach to generating text that prioritizes interpretability and traceability through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The core concept revolves around “Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation” (QBA) – a structured method for representing and evaluating the retrieved evidence used to inform the generation process.

Traditionally, RAG systems operate largely as black boxes, making it difficult to understand *why* a particular response was generated. ArgRAG addresses this by explicitly modeling the relationship between the original query, the retrieved documents, and the final output. QBA provides a framework for assigning a “polarity” – either positive or negative – to each retrieved piece of evidence, based on its relevance and support for the generated response. This polarity is then quantified, creating a numerical representation of the evidence’s contribution.

The system utilizes this quantitative data to highlight which retrieved documents were most influential in shaping the answer, offering a clear audit trail.  Instead of simply presenting a list of retrieved documents, ArgRAG provides a ranked assessment of their argumentative weight, fostering trust and facilitating debugging.  The architecture includes a core language model, a retrieval component, and the QBA module, all working in concert to achieve both high-quality generation and enhanced explainability.  Further research will focus on refining the QBA methodology and exploring its application across diverse generation tasks.
