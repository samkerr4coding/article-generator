# Graph Coloring for Data Science: A Comprehensive Guide

Is coloring a picture of a flower that has six petals arranged in a circle. She wants to color each of the six petals with exactly one of the following four colors: red, orange, yellow, and blue. No two neighboring petals can have the same color. Not all four colors need to be used. This was the basis of problem #25 in the 2025 Cayley Contest, and it happens to be a specific example of a class of combinatorial data science problems related to the notion of graph coloring. In the following sections, we will solve Rita’s concrete problem, derive its general open and closed-form solutions, and look at some interesting practical applications in industry. Note: All figures and formulas in the following sections have been created by the author of this article.

**A Theoretical Puzzle**

To solve Rita’s problem, let us begin by visualizing the flower petals as a cyclical graph consisting of 6 nodes connected by edges as shown in Figure 1:

Figure 1: An uncolored cycle of flower petals

Figure 2 shows some valid colorings (also called proper colorings) of the petals:

Figure 2: Examples of valid colorings

Let P(n, k) be the number of ways we can color a cycle of n nodes with k colors, such that no neighboring nodes have the same color.

Now, consider what happens if we break the cycle into a chain of n nodes. How many ways P chain (n, k) are there to color a chain of n nodes with k colors, such that no neighboring nodes have the same color? For the starting (left-most) node in the chain, we have a choice of k colors. But for each of the following n – 1 nodes, we have a choice of only k – 1 colors, since one of the colors will have already been taken by the preceding node. This intuition is illustrated in Figure 3 below:

Figure 3: From cycle to chain

Thus, we have:

P chain (n, k) = k * (k - 1) (n - 1)

However, notice that in some of these valid colorings, the first and last nodes in the chain will share the same color – if we subtract these cases from P chain (n, k), then we would obtain P(n, k) as required. Furthermore, notice that the cases to subtract are equivalent to P(n – 1, k), i.e., the number of ways to color a cycle of n – 1 nodes with k colors, such that no neighboring nodes have the same color. This so-called deletion-contraction maneuver is illustrated in Figure 4 below:

Figure 4: Deletion-contraction maneuver

Figure 5 below shows the base cases for P(n, k), for a given value k:

Figure 5: Base cases

Pulling all of these insights together yields the following first-order recurrence relation for positive integers n > 3 and k, with base cases as described above:

P(n, k) = k * (k - 1) (n - 1)

Since the numbers in this case are relatively small, we can carry out the evaluation by expanding P(6, 4) as follows:

P(6, 4) = 4 * (4 - 1) * (6 - 1) = 4 * 3 * 5 = 60

Using the expression for the base case P(3, k), note that:

P(3, k) = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2)

As a result:

P(6, 4) = 60

There are exactly 60 ways for Rita to color her flower petals while satisfying the given constraints.

The following Python function (compatible with Python versions ≥ 3.9) operationalizes the recurrence to let us quickly evaluate P(n, k) for larger input values:

```python
def num_proper_colorings(n: int, k: int) -> int:
    """
    Iteratively compute the number of proper colorings of a cycle graph with n nodes and k colors.
    Parameters:
    - n (int): Number of nodes in the cycle graph.
    - k (int): Number of available colors.
    Returns:
    - int: Number of proper colorings.
    """
    if n == 1:
        return k
    elif n == 2:
        return k * (k - 1)
    elif n == 3:
        return k * (k - 1) * (k - 2)
    # Initialize base case
    num_prev = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2)
    for i in range(4, n + 1):
        current = k * (k - 1)**(i - 1) - num_prev
        num_prev = current
    return num_prev
```

Graph coloring can also be operationalized using backtracking, a useful technique for exploring the solution space of various types of data science problems and incrementally constructing candidate solutions. This article provides an intuitive introduction to backtracking, and the following video shows how backtracking can be applied to graph coloring problems in particular.

**Closed-Form Solution**

The iterative Python function shown above has a time complexity of O(n) with respect to number of nodes n in the cyclical graph. However, if we can find an analytical or closed-form solution to P(n, k), then we would have a more efficient way to compute the answer. The closed-form solution is:

P(n, k) = (k * (k - 1)^n - (k - 1)^n) / 2

**Practical Applications**

Graph coloring, while rooted in combinatorial mathematics, has practical relevance that extends well beyond theoretical puzzles. Starting from a math contest problem involving flower petals, we derived general open and closed-form solutions for the proper coloring of cyclical graphs, and looked at how graph coloring can be applied to a wide range of data science problems. The key to such practical applications lies in smart problem framing: if the problem is framed as a graph in the right way – with careful consideration given to the definition of nodes, edges, and coloring constraints – then the solution approach may become readily apparent.

Graph coloring offers a natural approach to clustering by treating the data as a graph, where nodes represent individual data points and edges indicate some relationship between the respective nodes (e.g., similarity, class membership). Proper graph coloring helps ensure that each cluster is internally cohesive while being distinct from other clusters, providing a clean and interpretable structure for downstream analysis.

**50. Clustering and Feature Selection**

In data mining and machine learning (ML), clustering algorithms group data points together based on shared characteristics or relationships. Graph coloring offers a natural approach to clustering by treating the data as a graph, where nodes represent individual data points and edges indicate some relationship between the respective nodes (e.g., similarity, class membership). Proper graph coloring helps ensure that each cluster is internally cohesive while being distinct from other clusters, providing a clean and interpretable structure for downstream analysis.
